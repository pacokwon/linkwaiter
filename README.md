# Linkwaiter

`Linkwaiter` is a lightweight server designed to manage a compilation of useful external links(blog posts, articles, almost any educative link).
It has a very specific use case of automatically updating a single json file and the corresponding section of my personal blog(tba).

While this project was written out of necessity, I've taken advantage of it to write and learn Elixir, just for fun.
